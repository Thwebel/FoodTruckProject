# Food Truck Project

## overview
  This app allows user to populate an array of food truck objects. The user is
allowed to create up to five trucks and as few as one. The user populates the Food
Truck's fields: Name, food type, and rating. A fourth instance field, ID number
is populated automatically durning construction. The number is unique for each
Truck. The user may then choose from four options. Displaying information about
every truck in the fleet of food trucks, seeing the average rating for all
food trucks, and identifying the food truck with the highest rating and displaying
that trucks information. The fourth option is the 'quit' option, and ends the
program.

## Topics / Technologies
* Encapsulation
* Class objects
* private fields accessed by public methods
* for each loops as a means to access information of objects stored in an array 



## Lessons learned
  The most important lesson learned during the creation of this small app was the importance of encapsulation. All methods and fields were given the smallest possible visibility. This ensures that this app can grow without worrying about conflicting names. Additionally, private fields are only accessed through public methods, ensuring the program has control over what and who can alter those instance fields.
